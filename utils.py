def create_spkid_age_mapping(file_path):
    """
    Creates a mapping from spkid to AgeInMonth by reading data from a text file.

    This function reads a tab-separated text file where the first column represents 
    the child's ID (spkid), and the third column represents the child's age in months. 
    It creates and returns a dictionary that maps each spkid to its corresponding AgeInMonth.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    file_path : str
        The full path to the text file containing the spkid and AgeInMonth data.
        The file is expected to have a header row, followed by data rows.

    Returns:
    --------
    dict
        A dictionary where the keys are spkid values (as strings) and the values are AgeInMonth (as strings).
        If the file is not found, an empty dictionary is returned.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> file_path = r"~\Child_data.txt"
    >>> spkid_age_mapping = create_spkid_age_mapping(file_path)
    >>> print(spkid_age_mapping)
    {'AF': '72', 'TM': '84', ...}

    Notes:
    ------
    - The text file is expected to be tab-separated and contain at least three columns.
    - The function assumes that the first column contains the spkid and the third column contains AgeInMonth.
    - If the file is not found, a FileNotFoundError is caught, and an empty dictionary is returned.
